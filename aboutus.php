    <h3>Know more about US</h3>
    <p><i><b>Fashion and retail seems to be two different worlds. We usually differentiate Science from Art, operations from design. Two opposite profiles or skills, like ying and yang. The idea of the blog is understanding both sides of the coin.

        Retail is moving from flagship to brandship and different store concepts. Fashion retail is not dead, it’s just adapting to the digital era where omnichannel is creating new ecosystems.</b></i></p>
